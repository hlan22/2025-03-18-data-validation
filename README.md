# Data Validation Lecture (DSCI 310)
### Date Created: 2025-03-18

### Main Ideas:
* `pointblank` package for testing data and validating
* followed notes from <https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/lectures/131-data_validation-r-pointblank.html>
* learned about running website from a separate branch (called gh-pages), where you can keep all your website related info on just that branch to avoid clutter
* the benefits of (failing) tests with makefiles
